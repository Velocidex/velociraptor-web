Velociraptor works on macOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and others.
Velociraptor is distributed as a statically linked single binary. This
ensures it does not require runtime dependencies or libraries to be
present on the system making it easy to deploy with SCCM or Windows'
built in group policy technology.
