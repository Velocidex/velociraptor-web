Imagine you have received an alert about a potential suspicious
activity on a particular endpoint. One of the first things you would
want to do is to interactively examine the endpoint.

Velociraptor allows you to do just that! Simply search for the client,
in the GUI, and navigate its file system remotely. You can download
remote files, read registry keys remotely and look at evidence stored
in Volume Shadow Copies. All this in a natural, intuitive interface.


We will also demonstrate the FUSE interface. Velociraptor allows you
to mount a remote system's Virtual File System locally and then access
the end point's files transparently using the analysis tool of your
choice.
