## Quick start

**Just want the latest version?** Sure, it's freely available on our
  [Github releases](https://github.com/velocidex/velociraptor) page.

<!-- **Want some ideas on what Velociraptor can do?** Have a look at
some [Use Cases](../use_cases) that we've developed based on real-life
cases.  -->

We also recommend you review our [Getting Started](../getting-started)
documentation, which guides you through setup and running your first
hunts.

## Other setup options

Velociraptor can be used in many different contexts and deployed in
different ways.

* **Stand alone** - Most people want to start with a single client /
    server and check out the GUI. This installation method is covered
    under [Standalone Deployment](./stand_alone).

* **Cloud deployment** - If you deploy the server in a cloud platform
    such as AWS, it's possible to use automatically minted SSL
    certificates and single sign-on for authentication. This is
    covered under [Cloud Deployment](./cloud).

* **Triage mode** - Velociraptor can also be used to simply collect
    artefacts from multiple endpoints simultaneously, for later
    analysis and preservation, as described under
    [Triaging](./triaging)
