Velociraptor can be used in a number of contexts and deployed in a
number of different way. The following pages will help you get started
quickly.

Most people want to start a single server and client and check out the
GUI. This way you can see how Velociraptor can be useful to you
immediately. You can read about this installation method in the
"Standalone Deployment" page.


If you deploy the server in the cloud it is possible to use
automatically minted SSL certificates and Single Sign On for
authentication. You can read about this approach in the "Cloud
Deployment" page.

Alternatively Velociraptor can simply be used for triaging - simply
collecting artifacts interactivly from systems for later analysis and
preservation. You can read more about this mode in the "Triaging"
page.
