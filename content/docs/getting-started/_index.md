Velociraptor can be used in a number of contexts and deployed in a
number of different way. The simplest way is a stand alone server. If
you deploy the server in the cloud it is possible to use automatically
minted SSL certificates.

Alternatively Velociraptor can be used for triaging - simply
collecting artifacts from system for later analysis and preservation.
