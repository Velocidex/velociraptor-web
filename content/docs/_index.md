Welcome to Velociraptor's documentation.

If you're new to Velociraptor, you should start by reading the
[Getting Started](./getting-started) guide, which will walk you
through setting up a small test deployment.

The [User Interface](./user-interface) guide is also worth reviewing.

<!--
For some ideas on how Velociraptor can help you, visit the [Use Cases](./use_cases) section.
-->

When you're ready to see what Velociraptor can really do for you:

* Run some artefacts across individual endpoints
* Build them out into hunts
* Start customising the artefacts to your specific needs.

You'll be surprised how powerful and easy it can be.
