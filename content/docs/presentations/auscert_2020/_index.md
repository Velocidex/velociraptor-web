This workshop will be hosted on Tuesday 16th Sept. 2020 from 9am
AEST. It will be delivered using the Auscert conference digital
platform, so you can attend from the comfort of you preferred place.

This tutorial is an abridged version of our full 2 day workshop, so we
wont be able to cover all aspects of the tool, but there is a lot of
content. It is intended that you follow along and do all the exercises
yourself.

## Requirements

To follow along, all you will need is a Windows system or Virtual
Machine (for example Windows 10, or Windows server edition) with
administrator level access. You can obtain a suitable VM from your
favorite cloud provider or run the VM locally.
