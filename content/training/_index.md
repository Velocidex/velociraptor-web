- title: Velociraptor training (Online edition - US/EMEA)
  date: 8th Feb 2021
  description: |
      The life of an information security professional is a hectic one. It
      seems like you are fighting fires every day and always behind the
      eight ball. You know you should be proactively hunting for emerging
      threats in your network but the tools at your disposal simply do not
      scale. You can check each machine individually for hardening and
      policy compliance but you have many thousands of endpoints deployed,
      it is hard enough to keep up with the alerts.

      This online course will be split into 7 sessions over 2 weeks with 2-3
      hours per day. We will deliver the course live over Zoom in an
      interactive, hands on format. There will be time for questions and
      free discussions.

      Time slots are ideal for USA and EMEA based participants.
