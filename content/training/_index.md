      The life of an information security professional is a hectic one. It
      seems like you are fighting fires every day and always behind the
      eight ball. You know you should be proactively hunting for emerging
      threats in your network but the tools at your disposal simply do not
      scale. You can check each machine individually for hardening and
      policy compliance but you have many thousands of endpoints deployed,
      it is hard enough to keep up with the alerts.

      This 2 day course is an introduction to forensic analysis and incident
      response for information security professionals. We use a new open
      source endpoint visibility tool called Velociraptor, developed by
      Velocidex Enterprises. Velociraptor is a powerful endpoint tool – you
      can hunt for artifacts in minutes across thousands of endpoints and
      perform advanced forensic analysis on the endpoint, rapidly and at
      scale. Welcome to the future of DFIR!
