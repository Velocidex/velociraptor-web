      This workshop is an introduction to forensic analysis and
      incident response for information security professionals. We
      cover the basics of modern DFIR techniques exposing artifacts
      such as process analysis (VAD, Mutants, Handles), low level NTFS
      analysis ($I30 carving, timelining, recovery of deleted files),
      evidence of execution (prefetch files, amcache, SRUM) and event
      log collection and analysis.

      To illustrate the investigative process, we will use a new open
      source endpoint visibility tool called
      Velociraptor. Velociraptor is a powerful endpoint tool
      implementing many advanced DFIR techniques and will allow us to
      easily demonstrate many of the techniques we will learn in the
      limited time.

      The life of an information security professional is a hectic one. It
      seems like you are fighting fires every day and always behind the
      eight ball. You know you should be proactively hunting for emerging
      threats in your network but the tools at your disposal simply do not
      scale. You can check each machine individually for hardening and
      policy compliance but you have many thousands of endpoints deployed,
      it is hard enough to keep up with the alerts.

      This online course will be split into 7 sessions over 2 weeks with 2-3
      hours per day. We will deliver the course live over Zoom in an
      interactive, hands on format. There will be time for questions and
      free discussions.

      Time slots are ideal for USA and APAC based participants.
