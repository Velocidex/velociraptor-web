              <p>The life of an information security professional is a hectic one. It
seems like you are fighting fires every day and always behind the
eight ball. You know you should be proactively hunting for emerging
threats in your network but the tools at your disposal simply do not
scale. You can check each machine individually for hardening and
policy compliance but you have many thousands of endpoints deployed,
it is hard enough to keep up with the alerts.</p>
<p>You try to keep across the latest malware trends and threat Intel
feeds. You might even receive a tipoff that your network is
compromised by a specific variant of malware of an APT group. You wish
there was a way for you to easily inspect all your endpoints for the
indicators, digging deeper into any machines which might be
compromised.</p>
<h1 id="about-this-course">About this course</h1>
<p>This online course will be split into 7 sessions over 2 weeks with 2-3
hours per day. We will deliver the course live over Zoom in an
interactive, hands on format. There will be time for questions and
free discussions.</p>
<h1 id="schedule">Schedule</h1>
<p>We will cover one module per day. Modules are hands on and take about
2 hours. After the workshop we will stay on the Zoom for open
discussions.</p>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>The course is an introduction to forensic analysis and incident
response with Velociraptor. It is intended for information security
professionals, system administrators and incident responders.</p>
<p>Velociraptor is a powerful endpoint tool – you can hunt for artifacts
in minutes across thousands of endpoints and perform advanced forensic
analysis on the endpoint, rapidly and at scale. Welcome to the future
of DFIR!</p>
<p>This training event is run by the company behind Velociraptor - you
will learn from the developers and practitioners who use Velociraptor
every day to respond to incidents and investigate breaches. Course
materials and detailed preparation instructions will be distributed to
participants the week prior to the course.</p>
<p>You will receive access to the online portal which includes all the
training materials, as well as video recordings of the course
afterwards.</p>
<h1 id="course-contents">Course Contents</h1>
<h2 id="installation-and-introduction-to-the-ui">Installation and introduction to the UI</h2>
<p>The old way of performing in-depth forensic analysis and incident
response with your existing tools is clearly not adequate or scalable
to many endpoints. It is just too time consuming to analyze many
machines, acquire large disk images, and memory, let alone actively
hunt for indicators of compromise across your entire network.</p>
<p>You heard that Velociraptor, an advanced open source endpoint
visibility tool, is the ideal tool for effectively investigating,
hunting and monitoring your endpoints with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>You are excited to install Velociraptor and deploy it to your entire
infrastructure. This module is for you! In this module we will deploy
Velociraptor and gain an introduction to the basic operation of the
tool. We will learn the architecture and the unique mindset behind the
tool.</p>
<h3 id="exercises">Exercises</h3>
<ul>
<li>Installing a typical secure Velociraptor server on a cloud VM.</li>
<li>Deploy Velociraptor clients on a typical Windows network using group policy.</li>
<li>Introduction to the Velociraptor Query Language (VQL). It is the
workhorse behind the tool and mastering VQL will provide you with
the flexibility you need to adapt to rapidly changing challenges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interactive-forensic-investigation">Interactive forensic investigation</h2>
<p>Velociraptor puts the power of experienced digital forensic
investigators at your finger tips! This module will cover at a high
level the basics of modern forensic analysis techniques. You will now
be able to apply these techniques to answer many questions – from
determining evidence of malware execution, detecting persistent
malware to uncovering malicious user activity and determining
ex-filtration of proprietary data.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Basics of Windows Forensics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NTFS Overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Streams and the $MFT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recovering evidence of deleted files from $MFT and $I30 carving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the windows Registry?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspecting user hives and user profiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common registry based malware persistent mechanisms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is WMI and what information is exposed with it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lateral movement and privilege escalation using WMI – an attacker’s favorite!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WMI persistence mechanisms (Filter/consumer bindings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SRUM database can help us determine evidence of past
executions, connected networks, bytes sent/received and much more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Windows Event Logs are the cornerstone of windows auditing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are event logs structured?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are event Ids and how do they relate to messages?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some examples of common event log messages: lateral movement, powershell abuse etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interactive investigation – collecting artifacts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout this module we will use Velociraptor to gain experience
in analysis and searching for the discussed artifacts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="triage-and-data-collection--collecting-data-without-an-agent">Triage and data collection – collecting data without an agent</h2>
<p>A remote user is suspected of being compromised. The user is on the
NBN and therefore due to limited bandwidth, can not upload vast
amounts of data quickly. You need to triage their system to determine
if they are comprised. You would like to acquire memory, critical
files and capture as much of system state as possible. Unfortunately,
the user is not command line savvy – but luckily they are really good
at double clicking a binary!</p>
<p>In this module we learn how to perform offline collection with
Velociraptor. We prepare an automatic collection package which simply
acquires system state when double clicked.</p>
<h3 id="exercises-1">Exercises</h3>
<ul>
<li>Process listing, VADs, Mutants, DLLs loaded</li>
<li>Full memory capture</li>
<li>Collect file sets – registry, $MFT etc.</li>
<li>Configuring autoexec Velociraptor for simple double click execution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lateral-movement-and-hunting">Lateral movement and hunting</h2>
<p>You have discovered evidence of compromise on some of your
systems. Your boss wants to know if the attackers have laterally moved
through your network and the extent of compromise. You would like to
hunt for the indicators.</p>
<h3 id="exercises-2">Exercises</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hashes and file pattern based searches (Using $MFT analysis and directory walking).</li>
<li>Yara and Signature based searching. Searching both files and memory for patterns</li>
<li>Performance management of endpoints</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="monitoring-for-events">Monitoring for events</h2>
<p>You have learned so much in this course about how to detect malware,
lateral movement and compromise. But so far, everything was reactive –
we were looking at forensic evidence left behind after the fact. What
you really want is to design monitoring and alerting that will let you
know when evidence of compromise are found in real time. Luckily
Velociraptor is a complete endpoint monitoring and response tool!</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Velociraptor’s event monitoring framework</li>
<li>Windows Event Log forwarding and classification. Event log enrichment and prioritization.</li>
<li>Monitoring for changes in system state: New file executions and High
risk files such as office macros and remote PowerShell</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="this-course-should-not-be-missed">This course should not be missed!</h1>
<p>You have heard about Velociraptor and how it makes DFIR easy and
accessible. Learn what all the buzz is about from the people who wrote
it! This is a rare opportunity to become involved and support this
open source tool.</p>
<h2 id="testomonials">Testomonials</h2>
<p>What did you most like about the workshop?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hands on labs using various scenarios</li>
<li>understanding the potential of the tool</li>
<li>Good balance of theory and hands on lab</li>
<li>The structure of the course covered a lot of the theoretical basis and practical applications of the tool. Mike was happy to alter the flow of the course to better suit the participants which was much appreciated.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t know much about the product before attending so it was a great overview of everything Velociraptor.</li>
<li>Filled in some of the gaps in my knowledge about how Velociraptor works.</li>
<li>Everything! The course content was already inclusive, but extra thanks for considering my on_the_fly arbitrary requests and demo&rsquo;ing via <code>quiz method</code> :)</li>
<li>Mike&rsquo;s methodology for teaching process, the slides, the notes, i loved this course!!!</li>
</ul>
