      <description>Now that we understand what artifacts actually are, we are ready to collect artifacts from our endpoints. We will first discuss how to collect an artifact from a single endpoint, and later discuss how to hunt for the artifacts across the entire fleet.
Once we searched and selected the endpoint of interest, we can switch to the &amp;ldquo;Collected Artifacts&amp;rdquo; view.
The screen shows the artifacts previously collected on this endpoint.</description>

      <description>Adding or Editing artifacts through the GUI Velociraptor comes with a wide selection of built in artifacts, but the real power of Velociraptor&amp;rsquo;s query language lies in the ability of users to customize and develop their own artifacts - flexibly responding to their own needs.
This can be achieved via the Server Management screen - reachable from the side bar menu.
The Server Management screen consists of a tree view on the left hand side showing several high level categories of server configuration to edit.</description>
