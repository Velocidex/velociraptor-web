      <description>VQL plugins are the data sources of VQL queries. While SQL queries refer to static tables of data, VQL queries refer to plugins, which generate data rows to be filtered by the query.
Unlike SQL, VQL plugins also receive keyword arguments. When the plugin is evaluated it simply generates a sequence of rows which are further filtered by the query.
This allows VQL statements to be chained naturally since plugin args may also be other queries.</description>

      <title>VQL Event PLugins</title>

      <description>VQL Event plugins are plugins which never terminate - but instead generate rows based on events. Event plugins are useful for creating client monitoring artifacts. Currently, client side monitoring artifacts are specified in the Events section of the server configuration file. When clients connect to the server, they receive a list of monitoring artifacts they are to run. The client runs all artifacts in parallel and their results are streamed to the server.</description>

      <title>VQL Server Plugins</title>

      <description>VQL Queries can also be run on the server. When run on the server, VQL Queries have access to server state, and so can schedule new artifact collection flows on client, manage client label, and retrieve artifact results from hunts. It is therefore possible to post process artifacts on the server in arbitrary ways.
Server VQL queries can also be event driven which allows one to set up higher order escalations and alerting based on client side events.</description>

      <title>VQL Functions</title>

      <description>VQL Functions operate on value to return other values. Functions are useful to transform values obtained from a VQL row.
VQL plugins are not the same as VQL functions. A plugin is the subject of the VQL query - i.e. plugins always follow the `FROM` keyword, while functions (which return a single value instead of a sequence of rows) are only present in column specification (e.g. after `SELECT`) or in condition clauses (i.</description>

      <description>Velociraptor collects artifacts from end points but sometimes the significance of the collected information requires user interpretation. To assist in interpreting the collected information, Velociraptor can generate a Report.
Artifact writers use the report to guide the artifact user in interpreting the results and assessing the significance of these results.
The artifact file therefore contains a report section which allows the artifact writer to explain the significance of the findings.</description>

      <title>Artifact Tips</title>

      <description>When writing a new artifact it helps to use the following tips to make it easier.
Develop artifacts locally Although the Velociraptor GUI allows to change the artifact, and collect it from remote machines this is tedious in general. It is easier to just develop and collect the artifact locally.
Simply create a directory where you store your custom artifact, and run the artifact collector with that directory specified.</description>

      <title>Filesystem Accessors</title>
      <link>/docs/vql_reference/filesystem_accessors/</link>

      <description>Filesystem Accessors Many VQL plugins operate on files. However how we read files on the endpoint can vary - depending on what we actually mean by a file. For example, Velociraptor is able to read files parsed from the NTFS parser, compressed files within Zip archives, or even files downloaded from a URL. VQL specifies the way a file is read via an accessor (essentially a file access driver), and a path which encodes how the accessor will actually access the file.</description>
